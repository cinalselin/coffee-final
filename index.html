                        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                        <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up
                            my 9
                            to
                            5
                            job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
                            was
                            NOT
                            to
                            look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my
                            home.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the
                            business
                            but
                            have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I
                            serve
                            to my
                            family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.
